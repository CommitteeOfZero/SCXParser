# sc3ntist

A (heavily) work-in-progress interactive disassembler/debugger (read: it doesn't debug anything yet) for MAGES. engine scripts, because lord knows we haven't written enough tools for that crap yet.

Also includes *SCXParser*, which just outputs disassembly for all *.scx scripts in a directory.

**Not currently supported.**

### Warning

This program does little to no bounds checking. **Do not run on untrusted data.**

(and if you don't know what that means, this program probably isn't for you anyway)
